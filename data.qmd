# Data Background

## Data Source

### Data Set 1: Admissions and Releases 
The dataset can be accessed from the following sources:
 
- **Original source:** [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/prison-population-in-the-us?select=populations_states.csv)
- **Article discussing the dataset:** [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05980-2)
 
This dataset focuses on the U.S. prison population, specifically examining the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial disparities in incarceration. Collected as part of the study “COVID-19 Amplified Racial Disparities in the US Criminal Legal System”, it includes data on prison admissions and releases, broken down by race, across various states. Despite an overall decrease in the prison population during the pandemic, the proportion of Black and Latino prisoners increased. The dataset was gathered to understand how the pandemic exacerbated racial inequalities in the criminal justice system. The data is available on Kaggle and was discussed in a Nature article. Our focus is on analyzing data from 2019 to 2022, especially the long-term trends in admissions and releases, and how these trends relate to the pandemic's impact on racial disparities.
 
 
### Data Set 2: California Race Population 
The dataset can be accessed from the following sources:
 
- **Original source:** [US Census Bureau](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/)
- **Article discussing the dataset:** [USA Facts website](https://usafacts.org/data/topics/people-society/population-and-demographics/our-changing-population/state/california/?endDate=2020-01-01&startDate=2019-01-01)  
 
This dataset, found on the USA Facts website, uses data from the US Census Bureau and provides insights into California's racial and ethnic demographics throughout the years. It helps us understand how the state’s population has shifted over time, particularly focusing on changes in the population size of different racial groups. Notably, in 2021, the largest racial or ethnic group in California was Hispanic/Latino, with a population of 15.7 million. Between 2019 and 2021, the Hispanic/Latino population saw the most growth, increasing by 190,640 individuals, from 15.5 million in 2019 to 15.7 million in 2021. The dataset categorizes the population by race—White, Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Asian, and Other—allowing for a comparison across the different groups. This data provides valuable context for understanding demographic trends and shifts in California during this period.
 
 
### Data Set 3: California Monthly Admissions and Releases 
The dataset can be accessed from the following source:
 
- **Original source:** [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/monthly-admissions-and-releases)
 
This dataset, available on the California Open Data Portal, tracks the total number of individuals admitted to and released from CDCR custody on a monthly basis, starting from January 31, 2014, to the present. It includes monthly data on total admissions, total releases, and yearly net changes. The data is collected every month, allowing for an in-depth analysis of trends in the state's prison population over time. This dataset provides valuable insights into the dynamics of prison admissions and releases, helping to understand shifts in California’s incarceration rates.
 
 
### Data Set 4: California COVID-19 Data 
The dataset can be accessed from the following source:
 
- **Original source:** [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meongsuzacklee/california-covid-19-data)
 
The California COVID-19 dataset, found on Kaggle, covers the period from January 2020 to August 2023. It includes data from all counties in California, capturing COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as population data for each county and the state as a whole. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact across California, including how the number of cases and deaths varied over time and how these factors might influence the state's prison composition.

# Data Cleaning

[Link to the load_and_clean_data.R](scripts/load_and_clean_data.R)

We cleaned our dataset with the following steps:

## Loading the Data

- **Loading the dataset**: The dataset was read into R using the `read.csv()` function.

```{r}
# Load the dataset
library(readr)
df <- read.csv("admissions_releases_states.csv")
```

- **Checking the structure**: We used the str() function to inspect the structure of the dataset.

```{r}
str(df)
```
## Cleaning Steps

1. **Date Conversion**

We converted the date column from character format to Date format for easier temporal analysis.

```{r}
df$date <- as.Date(df$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

2. **Variable Renaming**

To improve readability, variable names were renamed using the rename() function from dplyr.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
data <- df %>%
  rename(
    Date = date,
    Total_Admissions = admissions_total,
    White_Admissions = admissions_white,
    Black_Admissions = admissions_black,
    Hispanic_Admissions = admissions_hispanic,
    AmericanIndian_Admissions = admissions_amerind,
    Asian_Admissions = admissions_asian,
    Other_Admissions = admissions_other,
    Total_Releases = releases_total,
    White_Releases = releases_white,
    Black_Releases = releases_black,
    Hispanic_Releases = releases_hispanic,
    AmericanIndian_Releases = releases_amerind,
    Asian_Releases = releases_asian,
    Other_Releases = releases_other,
    State = state
  )
```

3. **Handling Missing Values**

Missing values were identified and summarized using the sapply() function.

```{r}
missing_values <- sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
print(missing_values)
```

4. **Removing Duplicate Rows**

We used the distinct() function to remove duplicate rows and ensure data uniqueness.

```{r}
data <- data %>% distinct()
```

5. **Summarizing Key**

We calculated total admissions and releases by race for the entire dataset using the summarise() function

```{r}
admissions_totals <- data %>%
  summarise(
    Total_White_Admissions = sum(White_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Black_Admissions = sum(Black_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Hispanic_Admissions = sum(Hispanic_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_AmericanIndian_Admissions = sum(AmericanIndian_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Asian_Admissions = sum(Asian_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Other_Admissions = sum(Other_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

Similarly, we summarized total releases:

```{r}
releases_totals <- data %>%
  summarise(
    Total_White_Releases = sum(White_Releases, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Black_Releases = sum(Black_Releases, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Hispanic_Releases = sum(Hispanic_Releases, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_AmericanIndian_Releases = sum(AmericanIndian_Releases, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Asian_Releases = sum(Asian_Releases, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Other_Releases = sum(Other_Releases, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

6. **Saving the Cleaned Data**

The cleaned dataset was saved as an RDS file for efficient reuse in further analysis.

```{r}
saveRDS(data, "dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds")
```
