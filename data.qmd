# Data Background

## Data Sources

## Data Set 1: Prison Admissions and Releases
The dataset can be accessed from the following sources:

- **Original source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/prison-population-in-the-us/data)

- **Article discussing the dataset:** [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05980-2)

This dataset focuses on the U.S. prison population, specifically examining the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial disparities in incarceration. Collected as part of the study “COVID-19 Amplified Racial Disparities in the US Criminal Legal System”, it includes data on prison admissions and releases, broken down by race, across various states. Despite an overall decrease in the prison population during the pandemic, the proportion of Black and Hispanic prisoners increased. The dataset was gathered to understand how the pandemic worsened racial inequalities in the criminal justice system. The data is available on Kaggle and was discussed in a Nature article. **This is the main dataset we are focusing on for our project.** Our focus is on analyzing data from 2019 to the end of 2021, especially the long-term trends in admissions and releases, and how these trends relate to the pandemic's impact on racial disparities.
The data files contain information about monthly prison admissions and releases in the USA, categorized by race and state. Below is a description of the variables:

## Data Set 3: California Monthly Admissions and Releases
The dataset can be accessed from the following source:
- **Original source:** [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/monthly-admissions-and-releases)
This dataset, available on the California Open Data Portal, tracks the total number of individuals admitted to and released from CDCR custody on a monthly basis, starting from January 31, 2014, to the present. It includes monthly data on total admissions, total releases, and yearly net changes. The data is collected every month, allowing for an in-depth analysis of trends in the state’s prison population over time. We used this dataset to cross-analyze with our main dataset to ensure that the trends in prison admissions and releases align and reflect similar patterns across both datasets.

- **Date**: The specific month and year for which the data was recorded, formatted as MM/DD/YYYY.

- **TotalAdmissions**: The total number of individuals admitted to CDCR custody during the specified month.

- **TotalReleases**: The total number of individuals released from CDCR custody during the specified month.

- **YearlyNetChange**: The net change in the CDCR prison population on a yearly basis as of the specified month.

## Another reference: California Race Population
- **Original source:** [US Census Bureau](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/)
- **Article discussing the dataset:** [USA Facts website](https://usafacts.org/data/topics/people-society/population-and-demographics/our-changing-population/state/california/?endDate=2020-01-01\&startDate=2019-01-01)
This reference, found on the USA Facts website, uses data from the US Census Bureau and provides insights into California's racial and ethnic demographics throughout the years. It helps us understand how the state’s population has shifted over time, particularly focusing on changes in the population size of different racial groups. Notably, in 2021, the largest racial or ethnic group in California was Hispanic/Latino, with a population of 15.7 million. Between 2019 and 2021, the Hispanic/Latino population saw the most growth, increasing by 190,640 individuals, from 15.5 million in 2019 to 15.7 million in 2021. The reference categorizes the population by race—White, Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Asian, and Other—allowing for a comparison across the different groups. This data provides valuable context for understanding demographic trends and shifts in California during this period.
This analysis is based on a pie chart depicting California's racial and ethnic demographics from 2019 to 2021, rather than a full dataset. The chart highlights the shifts in the state's population across various racial groups, showing that in 2021, the largest racial or ethnic group was Hispanic/Latino, with 15.7 million individuals. Between 2019 and 2021, the Hispanic/Latino population experienced the most growth, increasing by 190,640 people, from 15.5 million in 2019 to 15.7 million in 2021. The chart categorizes the population into six racial groups: White, Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Asian, and Other, offering a visual comparison of these groups over the two-year period.

**How This Was Used in Analysis:**
We used this data to calculate proportions and compare racial compositions across three years. These insights allowed us to contextualize trends in prison admissions and releases relative to population demographics, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of racial disparities.

# Data Cleaning
[Link to the load_and_clean_data.R](scripts/load_and_clean_data.R)

We cleaned our dataset with the following steps:
## Loading the Data
- **Loading the dataset**: The dataset was read into R using the `read.csv()` function.
```{r}
# Load the dataset
library(readr)
df <- read.csv("admissions_releases_states.csv")
```
- **Checking the structure**: We used the str() function to inspect the structure of the dataset.
```{r}
str(df)
```
## Cleaning Steps
1. **Date Conversion**
We converted the date column from character format to Date format for easier temporal analysis.
```{r}
df$date <- as.Date(df$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```
2. **Variable Renaming**
To improve readability, variable names were renamed using the rename() function from dplyr.
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  suppressWarnings({
    library(dplyr)
    library(ggplot2)
    library(lubridate)
    library(readr)
  })
})
library(dplyr)
data <- df %>%
  rename(
    Date = date,
    Total_Admissions = admissions_total,
    White_Admissions = admissions_white,
    Black_Admissions = admissions_black,
    Hispanic_Admissions = admissions_hispanic,
    AmericanIndian_Admissions = admissions_amerind,
    Asian_Admissions = admissions_asian,
    Other_Admissions = admissions_other,
    Total_Releases = releases_total,
    White_Releases = releases_white,
    Black_Releases = releases_black,
    Hispanic_Releases = releases_hispanic,
    AmericanIndian_Releases = releases_amerind,
    Asian_Releases = releases_asian,
    Other_Releases = releases_other,
    State = state
  )
```
3. **Handling Missing Values**
Missing values were identified and summarized using the sapply() function.
```{r}
missing_values <- sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
print(missing_values)
```
4. **Removing Duplicate Rows**
We used the distinct() function to remove duplicate rows and ensure data uniqueness.
```{r}
data <- data %>% distinct()
```
5. **Summarizing Key**
We calculated total admissions and releases by race for the entire dataset using the summarise() function
```{r}
admissions_totals <- data %>%
  summarise(
    Total_White_Admissions = sum(White_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Black_Admissions = sum(Black_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Hispanic_Admissions = sum(Hispanic_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_AmericanIndian_Admissions = sum(AmericanIndian_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Asian_Admissions = sum(Asian_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Other_Admissions = sum(Other_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
Similarly, we summarized total releases:
```{r}
releases_totals <- data %>%
  summarise(
    Total_White_Releases = sum(White_Releases, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Black_Releases = sum(Black_Releases, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Hispanic_Releases = sum(Hispanic_Releases, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_AmericanIndian_Releases = sum(AmericanIndian_Releases, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Asian_Releases = sum(Asian_Releases, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Other_Releases = sum(Other_Releases, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
6. **Saving the Cleaned Data**
The cleaned dataset was saved as an RDS file for efficient reuse in further analysis.
```{r}
saveRDS(data, "dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds")
```


## Steps for Cleaning and Aggregating COVID Data:

To integrate this dataset into our analysis, we utilized the following process, consistent with Blog Post 7:

1. **Filtering Relevant States:**

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  suppressWarnings({
    library(dplyr)
    library(ggplot2)
    library(lubridate)
    library(readr)
  })
})

states_to_keep <- c("Arizona", "Maine", "Washington", "Wisconsin", "West Virginia","Utah", "Texas", "Oregon", "Nebraska", "Montana", "Massachusetts", "Kentucky", "Kansas", "Iowa", "Illinois", "Idaho", "Colorado", "California")

nyt_data <- read.csv("dataset/us-counties.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
nyt_data$date <- as.Date(nyt_data$date)
nyt_data_filtered <- nyt_data %>%
  filter(state %in% states_to_keep)
```

2. **Aggregating Data by State and Month:**

```{r}
monthly_cumulative <- nyt_data_filtered %>%
  mutate(year_month = floor_date(date, "month")) %>%
  group_by(state, county, year_month) %>%
  summarise(
    max_cases = max(cases, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_deaths = max(deaths, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") 
```

3. **Calculating Monthly Increments:**

```{r}
monthly_increments <- monthly_cumulative %>%
  arrange(state, county, year_month) %>%
  group_by(state, county) %>%
  mutate(
    monthly_new_cases = max_cases - lag(max_cases, 1),
    monthly_new_deaths = max_deaths - lag(max_deaths, 1)) %>%
  ungroup()
monthly_increments$monthly_new_cases[is.na(monthly_increments$monthly_new_cases)] <-
  monthly_increments$max_cases[is.na(monthly_increments$monthly_new_cases)]
monthly_increments$monthly_new_deaths[is.na(monthly_increments$monthly_new_deaths)] <-
  monthly_increments$max_deaths[is.na(monthly_increments$monthly_new_deaths)]
```

4. **Summarizing Monthly Totals:**

```{r}
monthly_covid <- monthly_increments %>%
  group_by(year_month) %>%
  summarise(
    total_monthly_cases = sum(monthly_new_cases, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_monthly_deaths = sum(monthly_new_deaths, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop")
```

5. **Merging with Prison Data:**

```{r}
data <- readRDS("dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds")
data$date <- as.Date(data$Date)
data_filtered <- data %>%
  filter(State %in% states_to_keep,
         date >= as.Date("2019-01-01") & date < as.Date("2022-01-01"))
admissions_monthly <- data_filtered %>%
  mutate(year_month = floor_date(date, unit = "month")) %>%
  group_by(year_month) %>%
  summarise(
    monthly_admissions = sum(Total_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),
    monthly_releases = sum(Total_Releases, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop")
all_months <- seq.Date(from = as.Date("2019-01-01"), to = as.Date("2021-12-01"), by = "month")
all_months_df <- data.frame(year_month = all_months)
model_data <- all_months_df %>%
  full_join(monthly_covid, by = "year_month") %>%
  full_join(admissions_monthly, by = "year_month") %>%
  filter(year_month < as.Date("2022-01-01"))
model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    total_monthly_cases = ifelse(is.na(total_monthly_cases), 0, total_monthly_cases),
    total_monthly_deaths = ifelse(is.na(total_monthly_deaths), 0, total_monthly_deaths),
    monthly_admissions = ifelse(is.na(monthly_admissions), 0, monthly_admissions),
    monthly_releases = ifelse(is.na(monthly_releases), 0, monthly_releases))
```
