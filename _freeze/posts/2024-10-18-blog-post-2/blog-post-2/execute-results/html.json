This dataset includes information on admission and release totals, along with the total broken down by race, the date of this data collection, and the states from which the data was gathered. The data comes from the article titled “COVID-19 Amplified Racial Disparities in the US Criminal Legal System,” collected by a team of researchers. This data was collected to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the racial composition of US prisons. Despite an overall decrease in the prison population, the proportion of incarcerated Black and Latino prisoners increased. So, the study aims to understand why this happened and how the pandemic made racial inequalities in the prison system worse. The data is available on Nature.com, a scientific journal that publishes peer-reviewed research and news.\n\n### We firstly found the dataset on Kaggle. There is a link to github(https://github.com/jkbren/incarcerated-populations-data/), which is also the original source of this dataset. Also, there is a nature article discussing about the dataset (link https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05980-2)).\n\n### The question asked most about this dataset is \"What are the long-term trends in admissions and releases across different states, and how do these trends correlate with changes in policy\". This is also the concern of policymakers.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf = read.csv(\"admissions_releases_states.csv\")\nstr(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n'data.frame':\t1914 obs. of  16 variables:\n $ date               : chr  \"2015-02-01\" \"2015-03-01\" \"2015-04-01\" \"2015-05-01\" ...\n $ admissions_total   : int  1583 1580 1779 1821 1689 1871 1784 1623 1673 1780 ...\n $ admissions_white   : int  600 615 706 730 704 758 760 659 673 734 ...\n $ admissions_black   : int  193 189 235 260 215 223 206 177 236 205 ...\n $ admissions_hispanic: num  633 640 701 669 618 738 670 629 636 696 ...\n $ admissions_amerind : num  130 114 115 125 129 121 119 123 102 110 ...\n $ admissions_asian   : num  6 3 4 8 0 5 6 8 8 10 ...\n $ admissions_other   : num  21 19 18 29 23 26 23 27 18 25 ...\n $ releases_total     : int  1649 1559 1693 1659 1570 1718 1637 1665 1653 1616 ...\n $ releases_white     : int  653 644 703 685 651 673 661 659 673 648 ...\n $ releases_black     : int  194 169 206 193 174 224 221 198 188 202 ...\n $ releases_hispanic  : num  688 610 657 616 603 662 626 653 641 630 ...\n $ releases_amerind   : num  85 111 93 136 111 132 107 120 123 108 ...\n $ releases_asian     : num  7 6 5 3 7 5 4 9 4 5 ...\n $ releases_other     : num  22 19 29 26 24 22 18 26 24 23 ...\n $ state              : chr  \"Arizona\" \"Arizona\" \"Arizona\" \"Arizona\" ...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n### Next, we read the CSV file admissions_releases_states.csv into a dataframe df.\n### We applied str() to display the structure of the dataset, including the names and types of the columns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf$date = as.Date(df$date, format=\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n```\n:::\n\n### We converted the date column from a string format to a proper Date format using as.Date().\n### This allows for easier date-based operations in the future.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata = df %>%\n  rename(\n    Date = date,\n    Total_Admissions = admissions_total,\n    White_Admissions = admissions_white,\n    Black_Admissions = admissions_black,\n    Hispanic_Admissions = admissions_hispanic,\n    AmericanIndian_Admissions = admissions_amerind,\n    Asian_Admissions = admissions_asian,\n    Other_Admissions = admissions_other,\n    Total_Releases = releases_total,\n    White_Releases = releases_white,\n    Black_Releases = releases_black,\n    Hispanic_Releases = releases_hispanic,\n    AmericanIndian_Releases = releases_amerind,\n    Asian_Releases = releases_asian,\n    Other_Releases = releases_other,\n    State = state\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n### We applied rename() to change the column names to more representative and understandable terms, making the data clearer to work with.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                     Date          Total_Admissions          White_Admissions \n                        0                         0                         0 \n         Black_Admissions       Hispanic_Admissions AmericanIndian_Admissions \n                        0                         0                         0 \n         Asian_Admissions          Other_Admissions            Total_Releases \n                        0                         0                         0 \n           White_Releases            Black_Releases         Hispanic_Releases \n                        0                         0                         0 \n  AmericanIndian_Releases            Asian_Releases            Other_Releases \n                        0                         0                         0 \n                    State \n                        0 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n### We applied sapply() to check for any missing values in the dataset.

Each bar represents a different racial group, and we used custom colors for the bars to distinguish them. The bars are sorted in descending order based on the total admissions for each race. The bar plot for total prison admissions by race shows that White individuals account for the highest number of admissions (865,467), followed by Black individuals (368,346), and Hispanic individuals (277,007). American Indian admissions (36,958) are notably lower, and Asian (7,396) and Other (18,627) groups represent the smallest proportions. These disparities highlight racial differences in prison admissions, and future analyses will explore how these patterns change over time, particularly focusing on significant periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(releases_melt, aes(x = reorder(Race, -Releases), y = Releases, fill = Race)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Total Prison Releases by Race for the Entire Time Range\", x = \"Race\", y = \"Total Releases\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10))\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"White\" = \"#1f77b4\",  \n    \"Black\" = \"#ff7f0e\",  \n    \"Hispanic\" = \"#2ca02c\", \n    \"American Indian\" = \"#d62728\",\n    \"Asian\" = \"#9467bd\",  \n    \"Other\" = \"#8c564b\" \n  ))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n### Similarly, this plot shows the total prison releases by race for the entire time range from January 1, 2000 to September 1, 2022. Like the admissions plot, the bars are color-coded and sorted in descending order of total releases, giving a clear overview of the distribution of releases among different racial groups. The bar plot for total prison releases shows similar trends, with White individuals having the highest release count (899298), followed by Black (407339) and Hispanic (307995) individuals. Again, American Indian (37153), Asian (7540), and Other (22,563) groups have smaller totals. Moving forward, we will conduct a time-dependent analysis to examine trends over various time periods, with special attention to the effects of COVID-19 on prison admissions and releases during the pandemic.\n\n### Transparency and representation are key principles in equitable data practices, both of which are relevant to our analysis of the prison admissions and releases dataset. We will ensure transparency by clearly documenting the data source, collection methods, and any potential limitations, such as missing data or sample bias, to prevent misuse or misinterpretation. Additionally, we will focus on representation by checking the distribution of different racial groups in the dataset to ensure no group is underrepresented, and we will acknowledge any imbalances that may affect our results. This approach helps promote fairness and accuracy in our analysis.",
