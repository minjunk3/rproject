In 2019, both admissions and releases remained relatively high, with fluctuations throughout the year. For instance, admissions peaked in June 2019 with around 650, while releases were highest in October 2019, reaching approximately 750. However, starting in early 2020, admissions dropped sharply due to the pandemic, reaching as low as 96 in April 2020. Releases also declined but not as drastically, and they continued to exceed admissions throughout much of 2020. By mid-2020, admissions began to rise again but remained well below pre-pandemic levels. In 2021, both admissions and releases stabilized, with releases generally staying higher than admissions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the dataset\ndata_MA <- read_excel(\"dataset/Admission_and_Release_Trends.xlsx\", sheet = \"Admission_and_Release_Trends\")\n\n# Filter and transform the data for Massachusetts (if applicable)\ndata_filtered_MA <- data_MA %>%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(Year, Month, \"1\", sep = \"-\"), format = \"%Y-%B-%d\")) %>%\n  filter(Agency == \"MA Department of Correction\") %>%\n  filter(date >= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & date <= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\")) %>%\n  group_by(date, Event) %>%\n  summarise(Total_Count = sum(Count, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = Event, values_from = Total_Count, values_fill = 0)\n\n# Plot the data\nggplot(data_filtered_MA, aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Admission, color = \"Total Admissions\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Release, color = \"Total Releases\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Prison Admissions and Releases in Massachusetts (2019-2022)\",\n    subtitle = \"Based on Alternative Dataset\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Total Admissions\" = \"blue\", \"Total Releases\" = \"red\"),\n    name = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\")\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",\n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\nFor comparative analysis of Massachusetts prison admissions and releases, we found a complementary dataset from the Massachusetts Government website, available at https://www.mass.gov/info-details/cross-tracking-system-state-county-correctional-populations. The dataset below \"Downloads\" section, titled \"Admission_and_Release_Trends,\" provides monthly records of the number of individuals admitted to and released from January 31, 2017, to the present.\n\nThe new dataset provides a similar timeline for Massachusetts admissions and releases but shows different numerical patterns and monthly peaks, reflecting possible differences in data sources or categorization methods. In 2019, admissions and releases also fluctuate, though the peak values are lower than those in the old dataset. For example, admissions reach a maximum of around 419 in June, significantly lower than the old dataset’s peak. In early 2020, both admissions and releases drop sharply, with admissions reaching a low of 23 in April—again lower than the old data. Unlike the old dataset, the new data suggests that releases do not stay consistently higher than admissions in late 2020; instead, they are closer in count. By 2021, both admissions and releases show a stabilized trend similar to the old dataset, although at a generally lower level.\n\nIn summary, while both datasets show similar patterns of decline and stabilization through the pandemic, the new dataset records consistently lower counts for admissions and releases compared to the old one.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata$date <- as.Date(data$Date)\ndata_filtered = data %>%\n  filter(State == \"California\") %>%\n  filter(date >= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & date <= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\")) %>%\n  group_by(date) %>%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Admissions = sum(Total_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Total_Releases = sum(Total_Releases, na.rm = TRUE))\n \nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Total_Admissions, color = \"Total Admissions\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Total_Releases, color = \"Total Releases\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Prison Admissions and Releases in California (2019-2022)\",\n    subtitle = \"Based on Original Dataset\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Total Admissions\" = \"blue\", \"Total Releases\" = \"red\"),\n    name = NULL \n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),  \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), \n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12), \n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\")) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",  \n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf = read.csv(\"dataset/Race_California.csv\")\ndf_2019 <- df |> \n  filter(Year == 2019)\n \nggplot(df_2019, aes(x = Race, y = Population / 1e6)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Racial Demographics in California in 2019\", x = \"Race\", y = \"Population (in millions)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_2020 <- df |> \n  filter(Year == 2020)\n \nggplot(df_2020, aes(x = Race, y = Population / 1e6)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Racial Demographics in California in 2020\", x = \"Race\", y = \"Population (in millions)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_2021 <- df |> \n  filter(Year == 2021)\n \nggplot(df_2021, aes(x = Race, y = Population / 1e6)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Racial Demographics in California in 2021\", x = \"Race\", y = \"Population (in millions)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the bar plot, we displayed the racial demographic population in California for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. This data was gathered from the USA FACTS website, which uses racial and ethnic population data from the US Census Bureau (https://usafacts.org/data/topics/people-society/population-and-demographics/our-changing-population/state/california/?endDate=2020-01-01&startDate=2019-01-01). During these years, the race categories remained relatively consistent in population numbers: Hispanic/Latino had the highest population, followed by White, Black, Multiracial, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. Moving forward, based on the dataset we are working with, we plan to categorize ‘Multiracial’ and ‘Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander’ as ‘Other’ to align with the race categories we already use. With this race demographic data, we aim to combine it with California's admissions/releases data and create a stacked bar plot. This will allow us to compare both sets of data and examine how the racial demographics of California compare to those in admissions and releases. ",
