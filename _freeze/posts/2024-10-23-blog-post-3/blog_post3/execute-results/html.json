The article highlights significant differences in admission and release patterns across racial groups and states, especially during the pandemic. It found that, although overall prison admissions decreased, Black and Latino populations were affected more by admissions and slower release rates than white populations. While some data from before the pandemic (pre-2019) is included, we chose to focus on data from 2019 to 2022. We also noticed that data is available for only some states, limiting our view of the whole U.S., so we plan to focus on a few specific states. The article explains that this is because states had different policies for releases and for reporting (such as self-reporting versus staff assignments).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata = readRDS(\"dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds\")\nhead(data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n        Date Total_Admissions White_Admissions Black_Admissions\n1 2015-02-01             1583              600              193\n2 2015-03-01             1580              615              189\n3 2015-04-01             1779              706              235\n4 2015-05-01             1821              730              260\n5 2015-06-01             1689              704              215\n6 2015-07-01             1871              758              223\n  Hispanic_Admissions AmericanIndian_Admissions Asian_Admissions\n1                 633                       130                6\n2                 640                       114                3\n3                 701                       115                4\n4                 669                       125                8\n5                 618                       129                0\n6                 738                       121                5\n  Other_Admissions Total_Releases White_Releases Black_Releases\n1               21           1649            653            194\n2               19           1559            644            169\n3               18           1693            703            206\n4               29           1659            685            193\n5               23           1570            651            174\n6               26           1718            673            224\n  Hispanic_Releases AmericanIndian_Releases Asian_Releases Other_Releases\n1               688                      85              7             22\n2               610                     111              6             19\n3               657                      93              5             29\n4               616                     136              3             26\n5               603                     111              7             24\n6               662                     132              5             22\n    State\n1 Arizona\n2 Arizona\n3 Arizona\n4 Arizona\n5 Arizona\n6 Arizona\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata$date <- as.Date(data$Date)\ndata_filtered = data %>%\n  filter(date >= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & date <= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\")) %>%\n  group_by(date) %>%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Admissions = sum(Total_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Total_Releases = sum(Total_Releases, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Total_Admissions, color = \"Total Admissions\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Total_Releases, color = \"Total Releases\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Prison Admissions and Releases for 18 States (2019-2022)\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Total Admissions\" = \"blue\", \"Total Releases\" = \"red\"),\n    name = NULL \n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),  \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), \n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12), \n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\") \n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",  \n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\"      \n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog_post3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe plot titled \"Total Prison Admissions and Releases for 18 States (2019-2022)\" provides insights into the trends of total prison admissions and releases during this period, with the blue line representing admissions and the red line indicating releases.\n\nThe data captures patterns before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, there is a significant decline in admissions from February to April 2020, with counts dropping from 17500 to just below 5000, coinciding with the early rise of the pandemic. Additionally, two spikes in releases are observed: one in April 2020, possibly related to prison population management, and another in July 2020.\n\nThe subsequent rise in admissions during September 2020, followed by a decline until November, suggests evolving responses within the correctional system.\n\nWhile this analysis highlights distinct patterns, it is essential to consider potential factors behind these trends. For instance, the lockdown may have contributed to reduced crime rates due to fewer people being outside, leading to fewer arrests. Additionally, individuals with minor offenses might have been released earlier to manage the pandemic's impact on prison populations. However, these interpretations are hypotheses that require further investigation and reading to confirm their validity.\n\nThis analysis underscores the complexity of interpreting shifts in prison data during unprecedented events like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_filtered <- data |> \n  filter(Date >= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & Date <= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\")) |> \n  group_by(date) |> \n  summarize(\n    White_Admissions = sum(White_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    White_Releases = sum(White_Releases, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n \ndata_filtered |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = White_Admissions, color = \"White admissions\"), linewidth = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = White_Releases, color = \"White releases\"), linewidth = 0.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"White admissions\" = \"blue\", \"White releases\" = \"red\")) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",\n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total White Admissions and Releases for 18 States (2019-2022)\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"White Admissions and Releases\",\n    color = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\") \n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog_post3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\nIn the white population plot, there is a steady trend in admissions and releases.

This spike is unrelated to COVID-19. During the COVID-19 period, admissions show a minor decline from February 2020, decreasing from 250 to 100, then rising again. Releases also exhibit a small spike in July 2020.

This targeted approach will help us better understand the differences in trends during the pandemic.
