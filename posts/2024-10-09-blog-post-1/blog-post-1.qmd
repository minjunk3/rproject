subtitle: "Three Initial Datasets are chosen"
description:  |
  Dataset 1 Dataset Link:
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azizozmen/police-killings-us Rows and
  Columns: 2,535 rows and 14 columns of data detailing police-related
  killings in the U.S. The dataset collects information on police killings,
  including demographic and situational factors like race, threat level,
  and mental illness, aiming to highlight trends and disparities. The
  data loaded successfully, though some columns like race and flee have
  missing values that need to be cleaned for accurate analysis. We can
  focus on exploring racial disparities, such as whether certain racial
  groups are disproportionately killed by police, and how factors like
  threat level or body camera usage vary by race. The main challenges
  include handling missing data and ensuring that the analysis of racial
  disparities is unbiased and supported by complete data. Dataset 2 Dataset
  Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/szamil/who-suicide-statistics
  Rows: great quantities Columns: 6 What are the main questions you hope
  to address?     •    Racial Disparities in Suicide Rates Across Regions
  I would like to analyze how suicide rates vary by race across different
  countries or regions. I can also analyze the trends in suicide rates
  over time for different racial groups to see how rates have evolved. What
  challenges do you foresee?     ⁃    The dataset is not separated by race,
  but nationality, which would make it more difficult to address racial
  disparities among suicidal rates.     ⁃    There are limited columns,
  which can reduce the potential for interaction between various variables.
      ⁃    Dealing with such a heavy subject, I would not want to oversimplify
  the complex phenomena. It doesn’t have any insight about the suicide
  risk factors, which I would be eager to analyze. Dataset 3 Data Link:
  https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/new-york-city-leading-causes-of-death/resource/845a3736-6ce4-46da-a82d-8a5f9add81f1
  New York City's health data is represented in a dataset showing the leading
  causes of death by sex and ethnicity since 2007. This resource, created
  from NYC death certificates, provides information on mortality trends with
  2,103 observations across several important variables. The data includes
  year, leading cause, sex, race, death count, and death rates, allowing for
  analysis of public health patterns in New York City. This dataset offers a
  chance to study important health trends, but it has limitations. The small
  number of columns may restrict the depth of analysis possible, and dealing
  with empty fields is another limitation to consider. Despite these issues,
  the data provides useful information about how different demographic groups
  are affected by various health problems over time. By studying this data, we
  aim to find patterns in death rates across different populations and identify
  potential areas where public health efforts could be focused.
