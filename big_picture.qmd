# Unmasking Racial Disparities in California Prisons During COVID-19

California, home to the largest population in the United States, provides a significant lens for understanding racial patterns in its criminal justice system. By analyzing prison admissions and releases from 2019 to 2021, patterns emerge that illustrate how systemic factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have influenced incarceration dynamics. This study employs two analytical approaches: population-based analysis, which evaluates the proportion of racial groups admitted or released relative to their total state population, and prison-based analysis, which examines the racial composition of total prison admissions or releases.

**An analysis of California's prison system during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that Black and Hispanic populations faced disproportionate admissions and releases, reflecting deeper systemic inequities in incarceration that persist despite emergency measures.**
 

## Shifts in Admissions: The Pandemic’s Effect

The analysis of **Total Prison Admissions in California by Race (2019–2022)** highlights changes in incarceration trends. In 2019, Hispanic admissions fluctuated between 1250 and 1500, peaking early in the year. Black and White admissions stabilized around 700, with White admissions reaching a high of 1400 in March. By early 2020, COVID-19 policies led to significant reductions in prison admissions, with numbers for all racial groups dropping to near zero. This decline reflected emergency measures designed to mitigate the spread of the virus.

As California began reopening in mid-2020, admissions rebounded to approximately half their pre-pandemic levels. By 2021, Hispanic admissions returned to around 1300, while Black and White admissions hovered around 750. Admissions categorized as "Other" stabilized at 250. Asian and American Indian data consistently recorded zero admissions, likely due to data reporting limitations rather than a true absence of admissions.

## Racial Patterns in Releases: An Uneven Landscape

The trends captured in **Total Prison Releases in California by Race (2019–2022)** reveal parallel shifts in releases. Hispanic individuals consistently experienced the highest release rates, peaking at over 3000 in mid-2020. This peak reflects emergency measures to reduce overcrowding, prioritizing inmates nearing sentence completion or deemed low-risk. Black and White groups exhibited similar trends, with modest peaks in early 2020 followed by stabilization through 2021. The "Other" group recorded a sharp spike in late 2019 before stabilizing at lower levels.

## Comparative Analysis: Population-Based and Prison-Based Insights

The dual approaches to analyzing racial dynamics provide complementary perspectives.

### Population-Based Analysis: Admissions

Population-based analysis examines prison admissions relative to each racial group’s total population. In 2019, 0.36% of California's Black population was admitted to prison, compared to 0.10% of Hispanics and 0.07% of Whites. The pandemic led to sharp declines in 2020, with Black admissions dropping to 0.12%, Hispanics to 0.03%, and Whites to 0.02%. By 2021, Black admissions rebounded to 0.28%, while Hispanic and White rates returned to 0.09% and 0.05%, respectively.

### Population-Based Analysis: Releases

For prison releases, the Black population consistently exhibited the highest proportions. In 2019, 0.41% of Black Californians were released from prison, compared to 0.11% of Hispanics and 0.07% of Whites. In 2020, Black releases increased slightly to 0.43% before declining to 0.28% in 2021. Hispanic release rates dropped from 0.11% in 2019 to 0.08% in 2021, while White releases decreased from 0.07% to 0.04% over the same period.

### Prison-Based Analysis: Admissions

Prison-based analysis shows the composition of total prison admissions by race. Hispanics consistently represented the largest group, accounting for 46.45% of total admissions in 2019, 46.22% in 2020, and 48.59% in 2021. Whites followed as the second-largest group, comprising 26.98% in 2019, 26.12% in 2020, and 25.14% in 2021. Black admissions made up 22.97% in 2019, 22.22% in 2020, and 21.13% in 2021, showing a slight decline. The "Other" category accounted for around 5-6% annually, while Asian and American Indian groups consistently recorded 0%.

### Prison-Based Analysis: Releases

For releases, Hispanics also represented the largest group, accounting for 46.21% in 2019, 46.21% in 2020, and 49.03% in 2021. Whites and Blacks followed similar patterns to admissions, with Whites comprising 26.58% in 2019, 26.66% in 2020, and 25.31% in 2021. Black releases accounted for 22.99% in 2019, 22.21% in 2020, and 21.44% in 2021. The "Other" category saw a decline from 5.38% in 2019 to 4.92% in 2020, stabilizing at 4.22% in 2021. Asian and American Indian release rates remained at 0% across all years.

## Key Observations and Implications

This analysis highlights notable differences in prison admissions and releases across racial groups in California, influenced by both systemic factors and the COVID-19 pandemic. The data shows that while total incarceration rates dropped during the pandemic, the magnitude of these changes varied across racial groups. Admissions and releases for Hispanic and Black populations represented significant portions of the total, with minor fluctuations over the three years.

Asian and American Indian groups consistently recorded zero admissions and releases, which likely reflects gaps in data reporting rather than an actual absence of incarceration activity. Addressing these gaps is essential for a more comprehensive understanding of racial dynamics in California’s criminal justice system.

By employing population-based and prison-based approaches, this study provides a multidimensional perspective on incarceration trends. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders interested in understanding and addressing racial disparities within the justice system.
